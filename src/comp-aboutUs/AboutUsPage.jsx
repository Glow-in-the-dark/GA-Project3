      <p>
        We are Willing hearts and we run a soup kitchen that provides around
        11,000 daily meals,island-wide 365 days a year (even on public
        holidays). we have a "no questions asked" policy, just as you would for
        your own family. That means that we provide meals to <bold>anyone</bold>{" "}
        who needs it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our belief is that every deserves access to a warm meal and we are
        committed to serving our community with compassion and respect. That's
        the mission of Willing Hearts when it was founded in 2005. We were
        awarded IPC(Institution of Public Character) status in2022.{" "}
